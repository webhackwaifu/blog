# 2021-16-03 set up ZAP proxy to intercept firefox requests in Kali Linux | Tutorial

Kali Linux is a great OS to get started with learning how to hack because it comes with a bunch of useful tools pre-installed, OWASP ZAP being one of them.

However, if you're a newb and you're trying to tackle some Portswigger labs - you might not know how to set up OWASP ZAP to intercept HTTP requests from a web browser.

Intercepting HTTP requests can enable you to do some real evil when carrying out exploits. Let's go over how to do that. 

### Setting OWASP ZAP as your proxy server in Firefox
The steps below generally hold true if you're NOT running Kali Linux and you have OWASP ZAP installed already, but Kali Linux was specifically used to write this tutorial. 

First, run OWASP Zap. In Kali Linux you can find this in "03-Web Application Analysis" category when you click the friendly button in the upper-right corner.

In OWASP ZAP go to "Tools" > "Options" 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2021-03-16-18-33-44.png)

In the "Options" window scroll down and click on "Local Proxies". Take note of the information you see in the fields on right, mainly the "Address" and "Port" fields. You will need this information for later.

Now, open Firefox. This is the default web browser in Kali Linux.

In Firefox, click the triple-bar menu button all the way to the very right, and click "Preferences".

In the search bar, search for "proxy" and then click "Settings"

Select "Manual proxy configuration" and fill in the fields as follows, then click "OK" to save your changes: 
- HTTP Proxy: localhost
- Port: 8080
- Check "Also use this proxy for FTP and HTTPS"

Note that when you try to visit a web page now, you'll get a "Did Not Connect: Potential Security Issue error." Interestingly, if you click "Advanced" on this page, the error code you get is a "MOZILLA_PKIX_ERROR_MITM_DETECTED" error code.

In order to see the HTTP requests you make in Firefox in OWASP ZAP (so you can intercept them and do your evil) you need to get the certificate from OWASP ZAP and install it in Firefox - so Firefox knows to trust ZAP when it tries to intercept requests. The certficate basically says "No, this isn't a MITM attack - I WANT to intercept the HTTP requests I make in Firefox, so please let me - I promise I am who I say I am." 

Go back to OWASP Zap, and in the "Options" window in the left hand bar click on "Dynamic SSL Certificate." 

Click "Generate" and then click "save". Save this certificate somewhere you can easily access it, like your Downloads folder.

Go back to your preferences in Firefox. In the search bar type "certificates" and then click on "View Certficates" 

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2021-03-16-18-46-03.png)

Now click "Import" and select the certificate you saved in OWASP ZAP. Then click "OK."

Now, attempt to make a request in Firefox. You should see these requests populate in OWASP ZAP.

### How to stop using the proxy server and use Firefox as normal 

If you want to stop using OWASP ZAP as your proxy server, simply closing ZAP isn't enough. You'll be met with an error message saying "The proxy server is refusing connections"

To fix this, go to Preferences > Search for "Proxy" and click "Settings" and then select "No Proxy" and then click "OK".

You can always go back to the proxy settings in Firefox and select "Manual proxy configuration" if you would like to intercept the HTTP requests in OWASP ZAP again. 

I recommend that you use one web browser, like Firefox, for proxying HTTP requests and another web browser, like Google Chrome or Chromium, for your research so you don't have to deal with needing to have a proxy server up and running all the time.
