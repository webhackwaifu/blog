Don't get me wrong, I love learning about hacking. 

But here's the thing, there's more to life than just sitting in front of a screen all day. In my youth I was encouraged to work all the time so I could "look good", so I could "make myself stand out to employers." It's not worth it. You get burned out. You get depressed. You feel unworthy, when in reality, you're probably doing just fine.

Don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with working hard and going hard and loving what you do. Yet, we all need breaks from doing the same thing all the time, and that includes learning about hacking. 

All that you see on the web, all the things you see on social media - at least some of it is a fa√ßade. We all have an innate want to seem impressive and to look our best towards our peers. 

Have a life outside of hacking, outside of the internet - literally do anything else - taking breaks is **okay**. Your career isn't going to falter just because you're not hacking 24/7. 

With that being said, here are some things other than hacking you could try:

### 1. Read a book.
Preferably, a physical one - so you can give your eyes a break from looking at a screen. Try going to your local bookstore or library. Ask a friend for a book - maybe you have some books you have been meaning to read but haven't.

### 2. Go outside.
(If the weather is nice, or not). Go outside and take a walk. When was the last time you went outside?

### 3. Spend time with loved ones.
I learned the hard way that we all have very limited time on this planet. Love the people that love you. Make at least a little bit of time for them before they're gone. This includes pets, too. Call them, play video games with them, share a meal; do something - and put the phones away. 

### 4. Play video games.
If your eyes aren't feeling totally busted after a day of hacking, try playing some video games. I've heard people say that playing video games are a waste of time, but is enjoying your life a waste of time? Obviously - enjoy and do things in moderation. Too much of one thing is detrimental to your future and your health. 

### 5. Sleep.
Sometimes all you need is a fat nap. Or perhaps it's time for you to retire for the day. It's almost never worth it to consistently deprive yourself of sleep.

With this list in mind, please always prioritize your health over hacking and jus about anything else. 

Remember, if you don't have your health - you can't hack!

Best,
