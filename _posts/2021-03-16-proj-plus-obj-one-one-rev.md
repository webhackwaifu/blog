*Wording directly from the exam objectives is in bold* 

*Disclaimer -  I am not an expert in project management. I am a student studying to get the CompTIA Project+ Certification. If you see that something is totally wrong in a blog post I wrote, call me out and I will fix it. Additionally, most of the review posts I am writing from memory, so if something seems as though it is plagiarized, again - call me out and I will fix it. *

When managing a project, you have to consider what characteristics define a project versus day-to-day operations. 

First, a project is **temporary**. 

This means that the project will have a **start** and a **finish**. Think of a project like a story someone is trying to tell you when you're having a conversation with them. This person is going to have a beginning and an end to their story. 

Second, a project is **unique**. 

This means that the project is going to have some sort of unique result. Even if two projects are very similar - say for example, the IT team is setting up computers in two different classrooms - these still count as two different projects. Why? The result of these two projects is different, they are **unique**. While the general practices of setting up computers in two different classrooms is the same, the results are unique as the two classrooms are two **unique** classrooms. 

Going back to the story analogy, someone will probably be telling you their story because it is **unique** in some way - they wouldn't tell you their story if it was literally exactly the same as someone else's. Even if their story is similar to someone else's, it's still **unique** in some way. 

Additionally, every project is going to have a **reason or purpose** for being carried out. Let's suppose you're working for a school. An example of a **reason or purpose** for carrying out a project related to network infrastructure might be because all of the routers, computers, and other networking equipment the school uses are totally outdated. The school wants to update their network infrastructure to newer devices and software (the project) because the outdated stuff is inherently insecure and far too slow to meet the new, sudden need for more modern, online learning (the **reason or purpose** the project exists). 

A **program** is a group of related projects that you are helping to manage in similar ways. Perhaps you are using similar principles or best practices to carry out these projects. For example, we can break down the project we talked about earlier in regards to the school wanting to upgrade their network infrastructure into a program, actually. 

Each classroom that has network infrastructure we want to upgrade can fall into its own project. When we are updating the networking devices in each classroom, the results are going to be **unique** for each classroom because the classrooms are well, all different classrooms. They all have different locations, different room numbers, different numbers and locations of power outlets, and so on. 

However, the act of upgrading the network infrastructure of all of the school classrooms can be considered a **program** because we are probably using similar principles and best practices to upgrade these classrooms. For example, for consistency purposes (let's just assume every classroom is just a generic classroom and isn't specialized for any purposes like CAD or graphic design - to keep things simple) we are probably going to make sure that each classroom has computers from the same vendor. Since every classroom is going to be used for the same thing, why would we put Dell computers in one classroom and then Apple computers in another? That's just going to make future management of these assets a pain in the butt for no reason. 

So, let's just say that every classroom is going to have Dell computers - all of which are going to be the same exact model with the same exact specifications with the same exact operating systems. When we harden the security of these computers, we are going to the same things on all of them - disable and rename default user accounts and passwords, manage them using group policies, update all of them to the most recent version of Windows, use the same antivirus software and so on. For simplicity, let's also say that all the school classrooms are going to operate on one network. So, all of these computers will be hooked up to the same network as well. 

That's a program. The classrooms would be different projects because although we are using the same general practices to set up the computers and network infrastructure in all of them, maybe each classroom has a different number of seats, so each classroom is going to have a different number of computers. Each classroom also has a different number of outlets, so we need to account for that too when we are setting up the computers. We also need to think about how we are going to name the computers in the network. Though each computer will be named using the same naming convention, the names will be different per room. So maybe a name of a computer will look like this:

```
 [room-number]_[computer number]. 
```

A **portfolio** for an organization is going to consist of a group of projects and programs that aren't related to each other. So for example, the portfolio of our school could include updates to the network infrastructure, updates to the school curriculum, and the rollout of a new training course to all staff members. Just like how if you're a web developer, your portfolio is going to consist of all of the things you've created, if these things are separated from each other in your portfolio - they are probably unrelated (save for the fact that you created them). 

Note that **operations** are daily functions that keep the organization running. **Projects** create a new result in some way.

For example, an **operation** of a school might include the paperwork that the administrative staff does every day. A **project** would be the updating of the network infrastructure in a classroom. 

I hope this review was helpful!
